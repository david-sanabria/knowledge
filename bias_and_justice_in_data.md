# Bias and Justice in Data
This is a special topic page, to pull together resources and references that can be used to counter bias.
Most of these resources were provided by coworkers, drawn from their own experiences.

## Overview
Last week at work, we had an open meeting to discuss social justice in the wake of recent killing of 
Black Americans by Police. It’s a sensitive topic, but a cathartic discussion was held by our leadership. 
The links below provide resources that are useful for anyone working with data and an interest
in understanding and reducing bias.
 
Bias is a significant data issue. Systemic bias becomes self-reinforcing and is further compounded 
by design choices made (or left unchecked and unacknowledged).  The first step to correcting a condition 
is understanding it. As a “data guy”, I have spent a lot of time reading and thinking about bias, as it 
affects, impacts, and is concentrated by the data systems we create, and through which we have come to 
understand the world.

  > “At this moment in our history, we can co-create data infrastructure to promote racial equity and the public good, or we can invest in data infrastructure that disregards the historical, social, and political context—reinforcing racial inequity that continues to harm communities. Building data infrastructure without a racial equity lens and understanding of historical context will exacerbate existing inequalities along the lines of race, gender, class, and ability. Instead, we commit to contextualize our work in the historical and structural oppression that shapes it, and organize stakeholders across geography, sector, and experience to center racial equity throughout data integration.”

# Digital Literacy
I started this page because my research on [data literacy](./data.md) led me to an OECD report[1] that 
includes this topic within the scope of "digital literacy". I found the sidebar on p. 187 to be
very helpful as it cites additional sources, including the report "Working Group on Education: 
digital skills for life and work"[2], among a number of other very interesting sources.

## Glossary
* Digital Literacy — An entire book is really needed to explain this broad topic.
* Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)[3] — ICT refers to technologies that provide access 
to information through telecommunications. It is similar to Information Technology (IT), but focuses 
primarily on communication technologies. This includes the Internet, wireless networks, cell phones, and other communication mediums.

# DevOps Knowledge

Here (Attached and linked) is some DevOps-related material that I refer to and share when asked about DevOps.
 
## Books

For personal development, you can get access to the full O’Reilly learning platform, SkillSoft books, videos, and course, as well as a number of other online learning resources with a membership to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). This is the best $100/year you can spend and gives you on-demand learning that you control.

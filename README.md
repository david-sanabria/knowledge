# David's Index of Knowledge
I use this GitHub repo to keep track of things that I find and want to keep track of more formally than bookmarks. I also keep related stuff in my GitHub [Gists](https://gist.github.com/david-sanabria), but those are usually scripts and different snippets of code.

I try to keep things split into topics or concepts, and have the following pages in this repository:
* [Data](./data.md) — Diverse range of data topcis including ethics, literacy, and laws
  * [Longitudinal Data](./data-longitudinal.md)
* [Digital Literacy](./digital-literacy.md) — different topic than [data literacy](./data.md), focus on digital literacy broadly.
* [DevOps](./devops.md)
* [Scripting](./scripting.md) – Resources for Scripting shell, Python, or (maybe) Perl.

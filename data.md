# Data Knowledge Index
This page keeps track of the things I learn about data (broadly). I'll peel it off into sub-pages eventually.
* Handy short link for this page: [https://bit.ly/know-data-page].
* See Also: My [Digital Literacy](./digital-literacy.md) page

## Ethics in Data
### Codes of Ethics and Practice
* Association of Computing Machinery — [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://ethics.acm.org/)
* Data Science Association — [DATA SCIENCE CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT](http://datascienceassn.org/code-of-conduct.html)
* [Oxford-Munich Code of Conduct](http://www.code-of-ethics.org/code-of-conduct/)
* Accenture — [Universal Principals of Data Ethics, 12 Guidelines for developing ethics codes](https://www.accenture.com/t20160629T012639Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-24/Accenture-Universal-Principles-Data-Ethics.pdf) (PDF)


### Articles
* Phi Delta Kappan — [Ethical and appropriate data use requires data literacy](https://www.kappanonline.org/ethical-appropriate-data-use-requires-data-literacy-mandinach/)


### Books
* Cathy O'Niel [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction)
* Tim O'Reilly [WTF? What’s the Future and Why It’s Up to Us](https://www.oreilly.com/tim/wtf-book.html)

## Data Literacy
Wikipedia's page on data literacy is in a sad state; I plan to use the information below to remedy that condition. (some day, maybe)

### Learning About _Data Literacy_
* [Dalhouseie Data Literacy Report (2015)](http://dataliteracy.ca/). Dalhousie University, 2015.
This is an **excellent** "synthesis report that provides a wealth of infromation including references to many sources of learning and informtion.
* [Data literacy instruction in academic libraries: best practices for librarians](https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/seealso/article/view/186335)
* [UBC—Library:Faculty Information Literacy Toolkit](https://wiki.ubc.ca/Library:Faculty_Information_Literacy_Toolkit)
* [Building a unified data and information literacy program: A collaborative approach to instruction](https://figshare.com/articles/Building_a_unified_data_and_information_literacy_program_A_collaborative_approach_to_instruction/1119760)
* [Working Group on Education: digital skills for life and work](http://bit.ly/2WRNnN0). UNESCO, 2017.
I found this report while looking at the OECD Skills Outlook 2019, which refers to this report (p. 187) as a reference for "Digital Literacy", within which "data literacy" is a component of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy. This is interesting from the perspective of understanding what "data literacy" and "digital literacy" are and why they are important to learn.

### Learning About _Data_
I am focusing on learning sources that have the highest probability of being available and remaining free. There are many non-free resources (such as the books listed below), of mixed quality.

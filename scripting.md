# Scripting Knowledge
I have been scripting since I discovered AppleScript in the mid '90s. I'm working with BASH and Python these days, 
though occasionally I have a need to work with other tools. I figured it was about time I started keeping track of 
things I find and use so that I can leave a trail that others might be able to follow. HTH.

## BASH
* [Install-jdk.sh](https://gist.github.com/david-sanabria/ab480f7c7c233f07525f19b8c99eb259) â€“ This script downloads the latest OpenJDK from the official source using a URL that is scraped from the user-facing web page. This is a very simple script.

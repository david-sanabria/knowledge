# Longitudinal Data
Information from Andrea Hollen:
* Chapin Hall’s classic post on longitudinal data (and entry cohort thinking): https://fcda.chapinhall.org/permanency/what-is-longitudinal-data-and-why-do-we-need-it/
* UC Berkeley has great material on the importance of longitudinal data in child welfare: http://cssr.berkeley.edu/ucb_childwelfare/  . I would argue that states should not have to ship their data out to research partners to organize it longitudinally and make it useful to operational decision making.
